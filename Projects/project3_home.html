            <h1>Brief Summary</h1>
            <p>Neo (Keanu Reeves) believes that Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), an elusive figure considered to be the most dangerous man alive, can answer his question -- What is the Matrix? Neo is contacted by Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), a beautiful stranger who leads him into an underworld where he meets Morpheus. They fight a brutal battle for their lives against a cadre of viciously intelligent secret agents. It is a truth that could cost Neo something more precious than his life.</p>

            <h1>My Review</h1>
            <p>I think matrix is one of the best movie ever made. Matrix makes you think about your life in different
                perspective. It is a type of movie that leaves you thinking and have something to discuss about with your friends.
                Warning spoilers ahead. The plot involves Neo (Keanu Reeves), a mild-mannered software author by day,
                a feared hacker by night. He's recruited by a cell of cyber-rebels, led by the profound
                Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and the leather-clad warrior Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss).
                They've made a fundamental discovery about the world: It doesn't exist. It's actually a
                of Virtual Reality, designed to lull us into lives of blind obedience to the "system." We obediently
                go to our crummy jobs every day, little realizing, as Morpheus tells Neo, that "Matrix is the wool
                that has been pulled over your eyes--that you are a slave." The rebels want to crack the framework
                that holds the Matrix in place, and free mankind. Morpheus believes Neo is the Messianic "One" who
                can lead this rebellion, which requires mind power as much as physical strength.</p>

                <p>
                    This particular track really set a unique tone to the movie character "Neo" in the Matrix.
                    Powerful sound, driving beat with an infectious groove that makes you feel invincible.
                    Maybe an oldie, but still a goodie. This song really makes you want to move. It is a club
                    hit or you can just chill with it in your crib. The break down hit you before you know
                    it and the song has a nice build up.
